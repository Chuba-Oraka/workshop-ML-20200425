    "# Kubeflow Fairing Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubeflow Fairing is a Python package that streamlines the process of `building`, `training`, and `deploying` machine learning (ML) models in a hybrid cloud environment. By using Kubeflow Fairing and adding a few lines of code, you can run your ML training job locally or in the cloud, directly from Python code or a Jupyter notebook. After your training job is complete, you can use Kubeflow Fairing to deploy your trained model as a prediction endpoint.\n",

    "# How does Kubeflow Fairing work\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubeflow Fairing \n",
    "1. Packages your Jupyter notebook, Python function, or Python file as a Docker image\n",
    "2. Deploys and runs the training job on Kubeflow or AI Platform. \n",
    "3. Deploy your trained model as a prediction endpoint on Kubeflow after your training job is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goals of Kubeflow Fairing project\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easily package ML training jobs: Enable ML practitioners to easily package their ML model training code, and their code’s dependencies, as a Docker image.\n",
    "- Easily train ML models in a hybrid cloud environment: Provide a high-level API for training ML models to make it easy to run training jobs in the cloud, without needing to understand the underlying infrastructure.\n",
    "- Streamline the process of deploying a trained model: Make it easy for ML practitioners to deploy trained ML models to a hybrid cloud environment."
